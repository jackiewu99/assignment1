    <p>Tigers are the biggest species of the cat family with a lifespan <br>
        of 20 to 26 years! Their most unique feature is the vertical black <br>
        stipes on their coats. The rarest subspecies of the tiger is the <br>
        South-China tiger which is extinct in the wild and currently live in <br>
        chinese zoos with a population of 50. Tigers hunt at night and prey on <br>
        animals such as deer and buffalo.</p>
