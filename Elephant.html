    <p> Elephant's usually have a life span of 60 to 70 years. They are currently 
        the largest land animal on earth. Elephants communicate with each other 
        through vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface. The 
        heaviest elephant in the world weighed 26000 pounds!
