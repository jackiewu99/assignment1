    <p>Penguins are usually found on the southern hemisphere and have an <br>
        average life span of 15 to 20 years. The largest breed is the emperor <br>
        penguin while the smallest is the little penguin. Penguins have a black <br>
        and white color which gives it a "tuxedo" look. Penguins need social <br>
        interactions to survive. A pebble may be used as a form of gifting.  </p>
